# Git-Prorate-Applet
Applet for University of Pennsylvania Penn Rec Membership Office.

Goal: Memebership Office at Penn Rec needed a way to display a daily prorated rate for each membership price. 

Result: Applet uses custom Javascript code that utlizes the day of the year, minus the days before the start of the fall semester (Sept. 1st), and individual membership prices, to calcualte a daily prorated membership cost.
